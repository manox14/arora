#summary The Unsorted drop zone

= Introduction =

This is short term dumping ground for bugs, tasks, ideas, and suggestions.

=== QtWebKit Issues ===
  * http://torchrelay.beijing2008.cn/en/journey/map/ show box or something when someone wants flash
  * Find, hit enter, link isn't followed
  * In statusbar: "Loading "url", completed 66 of 74 items"
  * [205030] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_economics assert on OS X
  * error pages screw up history
 
=== Qt Issues ===
  * hover over history menu doesn't show up in statusbar on OS X
  * http needs a cache
  * right click on the left side of the toolbar the menu should be empty, but it shows the menu for the first item

=== general ===
  * QMenu with no parent for OS X
  * view source in right click menu
  * syntax highlight in source view, find in source view
  * Enable the page cache in QtWebKit (see QWebSettings for that), a simple calculation like having 10 tabs with forward and back should work fast you are at 20 pages.
  * Start browser.  It takes a while before loading is completed (before you see the 'stop' change into reload) and in that time the location bar is set to the current value several times. Which is damn annoying when I try to type a new location ;) I expect that whatever the state, if I start typing in the location bar, browser will not overwrite it again with a new value.

Misc (maybe or nice to have or investigate later)
  * Download file ends with .download an then renamed?

=== Extensions ===
  * KWallet integration
  * Set the user agent
  * GreaseMonkey
  * Maybe could help with scripting design http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/611-Scriptable-Services.html
  * Start page of the Top 10 sites in the history

=== Bookmarks Dialog===
  * Select a bunch and move, order reversed, screwed up
  * Select multiple, right click and delete

=== Bookmark Bar ===
  * drop url on tab bar ether opening a new url or when on a tab in that tab
  * Should be able to show icons
  * flesh out right click menu on bookmarks toolbar

=== History/Bookmarks ===
  * http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany/BookmarksHistoryIntegration
