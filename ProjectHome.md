Arora is a lightweight cross-platform web browser. It's free (as in free speech and free beer). Arora runs on Linux, embedded Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Windows, Haiku, and any other platforms supported by the Qt toolkit.

Arora uses the QtWebKit port of the fully standards-compliant WebKit layout engine. It features fast rendering, powerful JavaScript engine and supports Netscape plugins.

Apart from the must-have features such as bookmarks, history and tabbed browsing Arora boasts:
  * very fast startup
  * integration with desktop environments
  * smart location bar
  * session management
  * privacy mode
  * flexible search engine management
  * ClickToFlash plugin
  * download manager
  * WebInspector, a set of tools for web developers
  * 30 translations

Arora began as a demo by Benjamin Meyer to help test the QtWebKit component, but since then it has grown into its own project outside of Qt.

Arora has a small, simple code base that is fun to hack on. Join the party in #arora on irc.freenode.org!
